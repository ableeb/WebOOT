    <h1>Welcome, ${user}!</h1>
    <p>You have found an experimental project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This instance is restricted for 
            atlas-current-physicists who are part of the 
            <a href="https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSubscription.do?egroupName=weboot-dev">weboot-dev</a>
            group.</li>
        <li>Scalability of <span class="host">weboot.cern.ch</span> is 
            currently a concern. When we understand the characteristics 
            better we can open it up to a wider audience. We have access to 
            more machines and deployment is easy, but first it is necessary to
            understand what it looks like with a few concurrent users.</li>
        <li>Whilst useful in its current state, it is currently still a bit 
            of a mess.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please report broken things, ideas or complaints at 
       <a href="https://github.com/rootpy/WebOOT/issues">WebOOT issues</a> on github.
       There are currently <span id="number_of_issues">lots</span> open but between us we'll get around to it. 
       If you record an idea, it can't be permanently forgotten.
    </p>

    <h2>A community project</h2>
    <p>You are currently looking at one instance of the WebOOT server, running on <span class="host">${host}</span>. 
        You can start your own instance on <span class="host">${remote_host}</span> or wherever you like in a matter of 
        <a href="https://github.com/rootpy/WebOOT/blob/master/README.md">minutes</a>.
        Anyone can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/rootpy/WebOOT/">github</a> 
        and start committing to it without permission from anybody.
        If you <a href="https://github.com/rootpy/WebOOT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING">make something</a> cool, let us know by sending a 
        <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">pull request</a>. 
        That will make the most of both of our time.</p>
    <br />

    <h2>Starting points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="${request.url}me/">${request.url}me/</a> :
        Go and look at some of your plots on AFS</li>
        <li><a href="${request.url}dashboard/">${request.url}dashboard/</a> :
        Find some plots that are being shared with you.</li>
